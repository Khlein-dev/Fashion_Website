                    <p align="justify">Fashion design has evolved significantly
                         over the centuries, reflecting cultural, societal,
                          and technological changes. From ancient civilizations
                           where clothing symbolized status, to the opulent styles
                            of the Renaissance and Victorian eras, fashion has always
                             been a mirror of its time..</p>

                    <h1>From Elegance to Liberation</h1>
                    </font>

                    <p align="justify">The Renaissance brought luxurious
                         fabrics and intricate designs, while the Victorian
                          era emphasized structure and modesty. The 20th century,
                           however, marked a shift—flapper fashion of the 1920s
                            symbolized liberation, followed by the sleek elegance
                             of the 1950s and the bold, expressive styles of the
                              70s and 80s.</p>

                    </font> 

                    <p align="justify">As fashion entered the late 20th century,
                         minimalism gained traction with clean lines and neutral
                          tones. Today, modern fashion blends streetwear,
                           high fashion, and sustainability, with an emphasis
                            on individuality and ethical choices.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the History of Fashion Design</h2>

        <img src="C:\Users\Kier Pascua\OneDrive\HTML Presetss\photos\909.jpg"   class="imagej">
        

            <p align="justify"><font size="9">F</font>ashion design is a fusion of art,
                 culture, and innovation that has evolved alongside
                  society. Throughout history, fashion has served as
                   a reflection of identity and societal values. In
                    ancient civilizations, clothing symbolized status
                     and tradition, with Egyptian linen, Roman togas,
                      and Chinese silk representing cultural pride.
                       The Renaissance brought intricate designs and
                        luxurious fabrics, while the Victorian era
                         emphasized structure and modesty, reflecting
                          conservative social norms.</p>

           <br>

           <p align="justify"><font size="9">T</font>he 20th century witnessed a shift in
             fashion, where design became a means of self-expression.
              The 1920s introduced flapper dresses that symbolized women’s
               liberation, while the 1960s and 70s embraced bold colors, patterns,
                and experimental styles. Minimalism gained popularity in the late
                 20th century, highlighting clean lines and simplicity.</p>

                 <br>
            <p align="justify"><font size="9">T</font>oday, fashion design blends creativity with
                 functionality, focusing on sustainability, inclusivity,
                 and technological innovation. With advancements like 3D
                  printing and AI-driven designs, fashion continues to adapt
                   to the modern world while maintaining its roots in artistic
                    expression.

                As fashion design evolves, it remains a powerful medium
                 for reflecting culture, shaping identity, and pushing creative boundaries.</p>
